    "# QUES.1 Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability, high performance, and availability in handling diverse types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL) differ from traditional SQL (relational) databases primarily in their data model and design philosophy. They are characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema flexibility: NoSQL databases like MongoDB do not require a predefined schema. Each record (document) can have its own unique structure, allowing for easier handling of diverse and evolving data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across many servers, making it easier to handle large volumes of data and high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: They typically provide faster read and write operations compared to traditional SQL databases, especially for certain types of applications and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use-case specific optimizations: NoSQL databases often excel in use cases where rapid iteration on schema and frequent updates are required, as well as in scenarios involving unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema requirements: When the data structure is not fixed and may evolve over time, MongoDB's schema-less design is advantageous. This flexibility allows developers to store and manipulate data without strict schema definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling of unstructured data: MongoDB is well-suited for storing and querying semi-structured or unstructured data, such as JSON documents, binary JSON (BSON), and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: For applications requiring horizontal scaling (adding more servers to distribute load), MongoDB's architecture supports this inherently through sharding, making it easier to handle large datasets and high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics: In scenarios where real-time analytics and fast data access are critical, MongoDB's indexing capabilities and distributed architecture can provide significant performance advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-native and microservices: MongoDB is often chosen for cloud-native applications and microservices architectures due to its compatibility with modern development practices and cloud environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios that require flexible schema, scalability, fast data access, and support for semi-structured or unstructured data types. It fits well in modern application development paradigms where agility, scalability, and performance are paramount.\n"

    "# QUES.2 State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), making it easy to work with data structures that evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not enforce a strict schema for its documents. Each document in a collection can have its own unique structure, which allows for more flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly Scalable: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. It supports sharding, which allows you to partition data across multiple machines, enabling high throughput and large-scale data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB uses internal memory for storing the working set of data, which enables faster access to data. It also supports indexes, including compound indexes, to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB supports a powerful query language that includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as well as aggregation pipelines for complex data aggregation and transformation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Failover and Replication: MongoDB provides high availability through automatic failover and replica sets. A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, indexing, and real-time aggregation, which allows for efficient querying and analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Deployment: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform). It also offers a managed database service called MongoDB Atlas.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB includes a specification for storing large files called GridFS. GridFS allows you to store and retrieve files that exceed the BSON document size limit of 16 MB by dividing them into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community and Support: MongoDB has a large and active community, with extensive documentation, tutorials, and support resources available. It is widely used across various industries for a variety of applications ranging from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a popular choice for developers and organizations looking to manage and analyze large volumes of diverse data efficiently. Its flexibility and scalability make it well-suited for modern applications that require agile development and evolving data models.\n"

    "pip install pymongo\n",
    "Step 2: Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how you can connect to your MongoDB instance using pymongo:\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replace with your MongoDB connection string\n",
    "# Format: mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name\n",
    "# If running locally on default port, you can just use:\n",
    "# client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the connection was successful\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # The ismaster command is cheap and does not require auth.\n",
    "    client.admin.command('ismaster')\n",
    "    print(\"Connected successfully!\")\n",
    "except pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure:\n",
    "    print(\"Could not connect to MongoDB.\")\n",
    "Replace \"mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name\" with your actual MongoDB connection string. Make sure to replace username, password, host, port, and database_name with your MongoDB server details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create a Database and Collection\n",
    "Once connected, you can create a database and a collection within that database:\n",
    "# Access a database\n",
    "db = client[\"mydatabase\"]  # Replace with your database name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection (if it doesn't exist) within the database\n",
    "collection = db[\"mycollection\"]  # Replace with your collection name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example document to insert into the collection\n",
    "document = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert a document into the collection\n",
    "insert_result = collection.insert_one(document)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted document's ID\n",
    "print(f\"Inserted document ID: {insert_result.inserted_id}\")\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"mydatabase\" is the name of the database you want to create or use.\n",
    "\"mycollection\" is the name of the collection you want to create or use within \"mydatabase\".\n",
    "document is an example document that you want to insert into the collection.\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible from your Python environment.\n",
    "Replace placeholder values (username, password, host, port, database_name, mydatabase, mycollection, etc.) with your actual MongoDB server and database details.\n",
    "This code establishes a connection, creates a database (if it doesn't exist), creates a collection within that database (if it doesn't exist), and inserts a document into the collection. Adjust the names and data as per your specific requirements.\n"
